# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this was to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge of credit risk. By using multiple techniques to train and evalueate models with unbalanced classes, we used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. We also over and under-sampled the data using algorithms and compared the models to determine the best mechanism for reducing bias. 

## Results

The EasyEnsembleClassifier had the most accurate and improved elements out of all of the ML approaches we implemented.

## Summary

Based on the data, the easyEnsembleClassifier was the best ML approach topredicting credit risk levels. Undersampling was the least efficient method.
